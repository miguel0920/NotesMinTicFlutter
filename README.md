## Requirements

For the app to work properly, you must have Flutter and Firebase installed.

- [Flutter Installation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Firebase Installation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios)

Optional:
You can install Firebase emulator for local testing.

- [Install firebase emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure#install_the_local_emulator_suite)

To run the Firebase emulator and store the changes made to its services such as user creation, etc. run the following command:

``
firebase emulators:start --import=./saved-data --export-on-exit=./saved-data
``

When running, the emulator will start and all the changes it will make will be stored in the './saved-data' folder.
